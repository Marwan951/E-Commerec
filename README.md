# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce System 

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This Java-based e-commerce system was developed to manage products. It showcases a modular, object-oriented design that simulates a basic shopping experience including product management, cart operations, checkout processing, and shipping logistics.

The system focuses on applying key **OOP principles** such as:
- **Inheritance**
- **Interfaces**
- **Abstract Classes**
- **Polymorphism**

## âœ… Features

- **Product Definition**
  - Products have a name, price, and available quantity.
  - Some products are **expirable** (e.g., Cheese, Biscuits).
  - Some products are **shippable** (e.g., Cheese, TV) and require a weight attribute.
  - Some products are **Expirable and shippable** (e.g cheese)

- **Customer Interaction**
  - Customers can add items to their cart with a specific quantity.
  - Quantity cannot exceed what's available in stock.

- **Checkout Process**
  - Validates:
    - Cart is not empty.
    - All items are in stock and not expired. (In progress)
    - Customer has sufficient balance.
  - Computes:
    - Subtotal (sum of item prices Ã— quantities)
    - Shipping fees (based on total weight of shippable items)
    - Total amount paid
    - Customerâ€™s remaining balance

- **Shipping Service**
  - All shippable items are sent to a `ShippingService` which accepts a list of objects implementing:
    - `String getName()`
    - `double getWeight()`

## ðŸ§ª Example Usage

```java
  Customer customer = new Customer("Marwan",40000);
  Cart cart = new Cart();
  shipping_service shipping_service = new shipping_service();
  checkout_details ChechOut = new checkout_details();

//cart
  cart.add(new Item(cheese,3));
  cart.add(new Item(MobScratchCard,2));
  cart.add(new Item(TV,3));

//shipping
  shipping_service.ship(cart.shippableItems(), cart);

//checkout
ChechOut.checkout(customer,cart);
